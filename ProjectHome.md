The **ea-emf-adapter** provides **(read and write)** access to your models that are located and managed in the [Enterprise Architect](http://www.sparxsystems.com) from within Eclipse via the [Eclipse Modeling Framework](http://www.eclipse.org/emf).

  * Installation available via this **update-site**:
    * http://ea-emf-adapter.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/git/releng/org.eclipselabs.eaadapter.updatesite/

<sub>(Please note that due to a required dll from the Enterprise Architect, only 32bit Java systems are supported)</sub>

To get started, start the **New Eamodel** Wizard from the **New...** menu.

Shown below is a sample model of the Enterprise Architect. It is at the same time open in the EA as well as in a simple tree-based EMF editor in Eclipse, for read and write access.
